# ProtoSyn.jl use cases

A repository to store complex use cases examples of ProtoSyn.jl. Note that only the input scripts and files are made available, as well as some of the interesting results. Scripts may not be runnable as is (for example, distributed computing scripts require machine definitions on where to run). Check each script individually.

__Check out [ProtoSyn.jl](https://github.com/sergio-santos-group/ProtoSyn.jl) main GitHub page for more examples, documentation and tutorials.__

## Examples:
1. Low resolution protein folding prediction (distributed)
2. High resolution protein folding prediction (GPU computing)
